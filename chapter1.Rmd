# About the project

*Write a short description about the course and add a link to your GitHub repository here. This is an R Markdown (.Rmd) file so you should use R Markdown syntax.*

I have some feelings of excitement but also worry if I will have enough time to complete the course. 
I hope to become familiar with the tools.
